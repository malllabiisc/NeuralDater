*Overview of NeuralDater (proposed method). NeuralDater exploits syntactic and temporal structure in a document to learn effective representation, which in turn are used to predict the document time. NeuralDater uses a Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), two Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) – one over the dependency tree and the other over the document’s temporal graph – along with a softmax classifier, all trained end-to-end jointly. Please refer paper for more details.*
### Dependencies

* Compatible with TensorFlow 1.x and Python 3.x.
* Dependencies can be installed using `requirements.txt`.


### Dataset:

* Download the processed version (includes dependency and temporal graphs of each document) of [NYT](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LcVaaffnW2ivnRTAVDiioYNXGtfSKvRy) and [APW](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V0eUJTOA3f3AhLIenubDcmcGs6bB0EA7) datasets.

* Unzip the `.pkl` file in `data` directory.

* Documents are originally taken from NYT and APW section of [Gigaword Corpus, 5th ed](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2011t07).

* The structure of the processed input data is as follows.

  ```java
  {
      "voc2id":   {"w1": 0, "w2": 1, ...},
      "et2id":    {"NONE":0, "INCLUDES": 1, "BEFORE":2, "IS_INCLUDED":3 ...},
      "de2id":	{"subj":0, "obj":1, "conj":3 ...},
      "train":    {
        "X":        [[s1_w1, s1_w2, ...], [s2_w1, s2_w2, ...], ...],
        "Y":        [s1_time_stamp, s2_time_stamp, s3_time_stamp, ...],
        "DepEdges": [[s1_dep_edges], [s2_dep_edges] ...],
        "ETEdges":  [[s1_et_edges], [s2_et_edges], ...],
        "ETIdx":    [[s1_et1, s1_et2, ...], [s2_et1, s2_et2, ...], ...],
        "ET":       [[s1_et1_type, s1_et2_type, ...], [s2_et1_type, s2_et2_type, ...], ...],
      }
      "test": {same as "train"},
      "valid": {same as "train"}
  }
  ```

    * `voc2id` is the mapping of words to their unique identifier
    * `et2id` is the maping of temporal graph edge types to their unique identifier.
    * `de2id` is the mapping of dependency graph edges types to their unique identifier.
    * Each entry of `train`, `test` and `valid` is a bag of sentences, where
      * `X` denotes the list sentences as the list of list of word indices.
      * `Y` is the time stamp associated with each sentence.
      * `DepEdges` is the edgelist of dependency parse for each sentence (required for S-GCN).
      * `ETEdges` is the edgelist of temporal graph for each sentence (required for T-GCN).
      * `ETIdx` is the position indices of *event/time_expression* in each sentence.
      * `ET` is the type of each word in a sentence. `0` denotes normal word, `1` *event* and `2` *time expression*. 

### Preprocessing:

For getting temporal graph of new documents. The following steps need to be followed:

- Setup [CAEVO](https://github.com/nchambers/caevo) and [CATENA](https://github.com/paramitamirza/CATENA) as explained in their respective repositories.

- For extracting event and time mentions of a document

  - `./runcaevoraw.sh <path_of_document>`

  - Above command generates an `.xml` file. This is used by CATENA for extracting temporal graph and it also contains the dependency parse information of the document which can be extracted using the following command:

    ```shell
    python preprocess/read_caevo_out.py <caevo_out_path> <destination_path>
    ```

- For making the generated `.xml` file compatible for input to CATENA, use the following script as

  ```shell
  python preprocess/make_catena_input.py <caevo_out_path> <destination_path>
  ```

- `.xml` generated above is given as input to CATENA for getting the temporal graph of the document. 

   ```shell
    java -Xmx6G -jar ./target/CATENA-1.0.3.jar -i <path_to_xml> \
    	--tlinks ./data/TempEval3.TLINK.txt \
    	--clinks ./data/Causal-TimeBank.CLINK.txt \
    	-l ./models/CoNLL2009-ST-English-ALL.anna-3.3.lemmatizer.model \
    	-g ./models/CoNLL2009-ST-English-ALL.anna-3.3.postagger.model \
    	-p ./models/CoNLL2009-ST-English-ALL.anna-3.3.parser.model \
    	-x ./tools/TextPro2.0/ -d ./models/catena-event-dct.model \
    	-t ./models/catena-event-timex.model \
    	-e ./models/catena-event-event.model 
    	-c ./models/catena-causal-event-event.model > <destination_path>
   ```

   The above command outputs the list of links in the temporal graph which are given as input to NeuralDater. The output file can be read using the following command:

   ```shell
   python preprocess/read_catena_out.py <catena_out_path> <destination_path>
   ```

    

### Usage:

* After installing python dependencies from `requirements.txt`, execute `sh setup.sh` for downloading GloVe embeddings.

* `neural_dater.py` contains TensorFlow (1.x) based implementation of NeuralDater (proposed method). 
* To start training: 
  ```shell
  python neural_dater.py -data data/nyt_processed_data.pkl -class 10 -name test_run
  ```

  * `-class` denotes the number of classes in datasets,  `10` for NYT and `16` for APW.
  * `-name` is arbitrary name for the run.
